# Unknown
Comment
: Has to do with smarter commenting. Uses treesitter file comprehension. Keyboard shortcut `gcc` is supposed to comment a file but it gives me a crazy long error. 


# Keyboard Shortcuts
- goto definition in the same file `gd`.
- goto file named under cursor `gf`.
- global-down search for word under cursor `gs` (via `:grep -Ir "string" *`)
- switch to another open buffer `<Space> b`.
- `*` / `#` initiate search for next/previous instance of word under cursor.
- `123G` goto line 123.
- `/` search within this file.
- `%` go to matching character (parenthesis, bracket, etc.)

Nvim-Tree
: Sidepanel file explorer for nvim. Open and close with `<Space> e`, no searching within.

Smart search open file in project
: Press `<Space> f`.
